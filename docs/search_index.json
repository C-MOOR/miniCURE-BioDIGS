[["finding-amrs.html", "Chapter 6 Finding AMRs", " Chapter 6 Finding AMRs Overview Purpose Learning Objectives Introduction Antimicrobial resistance genes (AMR genes) allow microbes to counteract the effects of antimicrobial drugs used to treat infections. Databases such as the NCBI Pathogen Detection Reference Gene Catalog and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database contain thousands of curated resistance genes and help make AMR-related data more widely available. Here we use the ABRicate tool which can mass screen contigs for antimicrobial genes using a variety of databases including the NCBI database. A similar strategy can be used to screen for virulence factors using databases such as the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB). [slides] [video] Activity 1 – Assemble Genomes Estimated time: 45 min Instructions 1. Run workflow Open the Assemble Genomes public workflow Click on Run and then Run Workflow on the fastp on data 5: Read 1 output dataset Wait ~30 minutes as the Flye, Bandage, and medaka jobs are scheduled, run, and complete 2. View results Click on the Display icon (eyeball) next to the dataset tagged bandage_contigs_image Examine how many contigs are large vs small, linear vs branched Questions You can refer to this completed history to answer these questions while you wait for your jobs to complete. 1A. Activity 2 – Finding AMRs Estimated time: 15 min Instructions 1. Run ABRicate Select “Tools” in the left menu, search for abr, and click on the ABRicate tool Configure with the following parameters before clicking “Run Tool” Input file: sample_all_contigs Advanced options &gt; Database to use: NCBI Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Reference Gene Database 2. View results Click on the Display icon (eyeball) next to the ABRicate report file dataset Examine how many contigs contain an antimicrobial gene (Column 2) and how many categories of resistance genes are found (Column 15) Questions 2A.
