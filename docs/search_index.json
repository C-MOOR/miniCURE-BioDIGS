This particular miniCURE introduces students to soil metagenomics data generated by the GDSCN BioDIGS consortium which researches soil biodiversity and ecological factors that impact human health and ecological concerns. Students who complete this work are encouraged to dig deeper into the BioDIGS book for additional datasets, tutorials, and community.

Run workflow Open the Trim and QC Reads public workflow Click on Run and then Run Workflow on the Barcode10_Spike2.fastq.gz dataset Wait ~25 minutes as the NanoPlot, Porechop, and fastp jobs are scheduled, run, and complete 3. View results Click on the Display icon (eyeball) next to the dataset tagged NanoPlot-Original Compare the number of reads, length, quality, etc. with the report tagged NanoPlot-QCed Questions You can refer to this completed history to answer these questions while you wait for your jobs to complete. 1A. How many megabases were sequenced? What percentage was removed by the trimming step? 1B. What are the median and mean read lengths? Why is the mean is longer than the median? Activity 2 – Taxonomy Profiling Estimated time: 50 min (~25-35 min computing) Instructions 1. Run workflow Open the Taxonomy Profiling public workflow Click on Run and then Run Workflow with the following parameters Dataset: fastp on data 5: Read 1 output kraken_database: Prebuilt Refseq indexes: PlusPF Wait ~35 minutes as the Kraken2, KrakenTools, and Krona jobs are scheduled, run, and complete 2.

Databases such as the NCBI Pathogen Detection Reference Gene Catalog and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database contain thousands of curated resistance genes and help make AMR-related data more widely available. Here we use the ABRicate tool which can mass screen contigs for antimicrobial genes using a variety of databases including the NCBI database. A similar strategy can be used to screen for virulence factors using databases such as the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB).

How many contigs were assembled? 1B. Why did flye separate these in this way? How does flye decide to group them into this numbers of contigs? Activity 2 – Finding AMRs Estimated time: 15 min Instructions 1. Run ABRicate Select “Tools” in the left menu, search for abr, and click on the ABRicate tool Configure with the following parameters before clicking “Run Tool” Input file: sample_all_contigs Advanced options &gt; Database to use: NCBI Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Reference Gene Database 2.

How many antibiotic resistance genes were found in the sample? 2B. Which antibiotic genes were found on which contigs? 2C. What antibiotics are associated with the identified antibiotic genes? What is the target of the antibiotic(s) and mechanism of action?
