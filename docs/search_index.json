[["scientific-literature.html", "Chapter 2 Scientific Literature", " Chapter 2 Scientific Literature Soil contains an estimated 59% +/-15% of the species diversity on Earth (Anthony, Bender, and van der Heijden 2023). To enable mining of this vast microbial biodiversity and genetic resource, Ma and colleagues created a genomic catalogue by analyzing 3,304 soil metagenomes (Ma et al 2023). Dig into this paper to learn more about how the authors reconstructed 40,039 soil metagenome-assembled genome bins (the SMAG catalogue) to identify previously uncharacterized archael and bacterial diversity and improve our understanding of soil biosynthetic potential.
