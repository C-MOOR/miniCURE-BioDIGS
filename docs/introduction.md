# Introduction

## C-MOOR BioDIGS Overview

The [C-MOOR](https://www.c-moor.org){target="_blank"} project works to create early research experiences through curricula like our [miniCUREs](http://science.c-moor.org/miniCURE-RNA-seq/c-moor-minicure-overview.html){target="_blank"} that help integrate data science and hands-on research into lower level coursework.
This particular miniCURE introduces students to soil metagenomics data generated by the GDSCN [BioDIGS](http://biodigs.gdscn.org){target="_blank"} consortium which researches soil biodiversity and ecological factors that impact human health and ecological concerns.
Students who complete this work are encouraged to dig deeper into the BioDIGS [book](https://hutchdatascience.org/GDSCN_BioDIGS_Book){target="_blank"} for additional datasets, tutorials, and community.
